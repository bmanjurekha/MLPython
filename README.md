# MLPython
# Machine Learning with Python using Linear Regression Algorithm


Data set which I have choosen contains # Age, #Sex, #BMI, #Smoker/Non-Smoker and #Insurance Charges.
Here the task is to predict insurance charges based on Age, BMI, Smoker/Non-Smoker.
#Reason to Choose Linear Regression Alg : 
There is a strong corelation between variables in the dataset, Linear Regression Alg will predict the value of 
dependent variable based on value of independent variables.
This dataset has a strong corelation between dependent variable - insurances charges and independent variables - Age, Sex, BMI, Smoker/Non-Smoker
#Using Linear Regression Alg
I want to predict Insurance Charges which is a dependent variable is based on value of independent variable that is Age, BMI
Smoker/Non-Smoker

Predictions were done based on user input using REST APIs (http://localhost:5000/predict).


Sample prediction for user input - 4.

Insurance Cost Prediction for a 40 year old male, Smoker having BMI 42 is $36709.43
